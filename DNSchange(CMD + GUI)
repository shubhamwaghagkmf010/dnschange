# Guide to Setting DNS Servers

This document provides instructions on how to configure the DNS (Domain Name System) servers on your Windows 10 Pro system to use Google's Public DNS (Primary: 8.8.8.8, Secondary: 8.8.4.4). You can choose to use either the Command Prompt (CMD) or the manual Graphical User Interface (GUI) method.

## 1. Using Command Prompt (CMD)

This method utilizes the `netsh` command-line utility for network configuration.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**
    * Press the Windows key.
    * Type `cmd`.
    * Right-click on the "Command Prompt" result and select "Run as administrator". Click "Yes" if prompted by User Account Control.

2.  **Identify Your Network Interface Name:**
    * Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```
        netsh interface show interface
        ```
    * Look for the name of your active network connection (e.g., "Ethernet", "Wi-Fi"). Note this name down.

3.  **Set the Primary DNS Server:**
    * Replace `"Your Network Adapter Name"` with the actual name you noted.
    * Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```
        netsh interface ip set dns name="Your Network Adapter Name" source="static" address="8.8.8.8"
        ```
        **Example (if your adapter name is "Ethernet & Wi-Fi"):**
      **For Ethernet**
        ```
        netsh interface ipv4 set dns name="Ethernet" static 8.8.8.8
        ```
        **For WI-FI**
        ```
        netsh interface ipv4 set dns name="Wi-Fi" static 8.8.8.8
        ```

4.  **Add the Secondary DNS Server:**
    * Again, replace `"Your Network Adapter Name"` with the correct name.
    * Type the following command and press Enter:
         **Example (if your adapter name is "Ethernet & Wi-Fi"):**
     
     **For Ethernet**
        ```
        netsh interface ipv4 add dns name="Ethernet" 8.8.4.4 index=2
        ```
      **For WI-FI:**
        ```
        netsh interface ipv4 add dns name="Wi-Fi" 8.8.4.4 index=2
        ```

5.  **Verify the DNS Settings (Optional):**
    * Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```
        ipconfig /all
        ```
    * Look for the section corresponding to your network adapter. You should see "DNS Servers" listed with 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.

6.  **Close Command Prompt:**
    * Type `exit` and press Enter, or simply close the window.

## 2. Using Manual Graphical User Interface (GUI)

This method involves using the Windows Settings app and the Network Connections window.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Network Connections:**
    * Press the Windows key.
    * Type `ncpa.cpl` and press Enter. This will open the "Network Connections" window.

2.  **Identify Your Network Adapter:**
    * Locate your active network connection (e.g., "Ethernet" or your Wi-Fi network name).

3.  **Open Network Adapter Properties:**
    * Right-click on your active network adapter and select "Properties".

4.  **Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4):**
    * In the list of items, find and select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)".

5.  **Click the "Properties" Button:**
    * With "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" selected, click the "Properties" button.

6.  **Configure DNS Server Addresses:**
    * In the "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties" window, locate the section "Use the following DNS server addresses:".
    * Select this option (if it's not already selected).
    * In the "Preferred DNS server:" field, enter `8.8.8.8`.
    * In the "Alternate DNS server:" field, enter `8.8.4.4`.

7.  **Optional: Configure IPv6 DNS (If Applicable):**
    * If you are using IPv6, in the "Network Connections" window, select "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" and click "Properties".
    * Select "Use the following DNS server addresses:" and enter the Google Public IPv6 DNS servers:
        * Preferred DNS server: `2001:4860:4860::8888`
        * Alternate DNS server: `2001:4860:4860::8844`

8.  **Click "OK" on All Open Windows:**
    * Click "OK" on the "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties" window.
    * Click "Close" on the "Network Adapter Properties" window.

9.  **Verify the DNS Settings (Optional):**
    * Open Command Prompt (as a regular user).
    * Type `ipconfig /all` and press Enter.
    * Look for your network adapter's information. Under "DNS Servers", you should see 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (and the IPv6 addresses if you configured them).

## 3. Important Notes

* Setting DNS via Command Prompt requires administrator privileges.
* Ensure you use the correct name of your active network adapter in the Command Prompt commands.
* These instructions assume you want to set static DNS servers. If your network is configured to automatically receive DNS servers from a DHCP server, these manual settings will override the automatic assignment.
* **Reverting to Automatic DNS:**
    * **CMD:** Use the command `netsh interface ip set dns name="Your Network Adapter Name" source="dhcp"`
    * **GUI:** In the "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties", select "Obtain DNS server address automatically".
